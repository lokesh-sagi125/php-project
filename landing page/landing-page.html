      <h2>Imagine going to a mall so you can enjoy a weekend of stress free shopping, or hanging out with your friends or for a movie
        but you go there only to find out the mall is super crowded and
        it's not what you were looking for? Design a system that
        monitors the crowd in public places like
        gardens/malls/amusement parks in a locality and gives real
        time updates about the crowd movement and traffic around
        the area. Also add in a feature to predict the conditions in the
        next few hours/days. WE HELP YOU HANDLE THIS .</h2>
